# websites

This repository contains the source for my websites as well as the themes that
powers them. I've built the whole lot of them in
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and a whole host of
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugins, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for
styling and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting my CSS, which is
written as CSS Modules.

Finally, everything is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) using
some fun environment variable detection.
