This is my website, written in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and a whole host of
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugins, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for
styling and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting my CSS, which is
written in Sass. Finally, everything is deployed with
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
