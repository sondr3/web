title: Setting up lego for wildcard SSL on Debian with `systemd`

How to setup [lego][lego] for Debian 10 with `systemd` timer and service.

## Installation

1. Follow the instructions on lego's homepage to install it. I personally downloaded the
   latest release and moved it to `/usr/local/bin` to be able to access it from anywhere.
2. Install `nginx`, I personally use their [instructions][nginx]. Also, remember to enable
   and start its service before moving on.

## Configuration

Next, I'm going to use the DNS with Cloudflare, meaning you have to create an API key
for your account. You can again follow the instructions on lego's website. I personally
used a custom API token, corresponding to the `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` token.

## Getting the initial certificate

To accept the TOS and generate the initial certificate, run the following command. Note
that we change the default `$USER/.lego` to `/etc/lego/` as we will need better access
to the certificates when using nginx.

```
CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=token LEGO_PATH=/etc/lego/ sudo lego --email your@mail.com --dns cloudflare --domains *.domain.com run --must-staple
```

After accepting and waiting for a little while, it should finish and print:

```
2020/12/19 22:05:38 [INFO] [*.domain.com] The server validated our request
2020/12/19 22:05:38 [INFO] [*.domain.com] acme: Cleaning DNS-01 challenge
2020/12/19 22:05:39 [INFO] [*.domain.com] acme: Validations succeeded; requesting certificates
2020/12/19 22:05:39 [INFO] [*.domain.com] Server responded with a certificate.
```

### `systemd` service

Create a new service in `/etc/systemd/system/`, for example `sudoedit /etc/systemd/system/lego.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=lego
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=oneshot
Environment="LEGO_PATH=/etc/lego/"
Environment="CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=abcdefgh"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lego --email your@mail.com --dns cloudflare --domains *.domain.com renew --must-staple --renew-hook="systemctl reload nginx"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

1. Change to your own domain and email.

Then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl enable lego`.

#### [TIP]

If you change your service file after enabling it, you should rerun `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
and then do `sudo systemctl reenable lego`.

## Configuring `nginx`

Then you need to add the certificates to your configuration. I've included how to add them, but the rest of
the configuration for nginx is out of scope for this tutorial. I highly recommend using the
[Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator][ssl] to configure SSL.

```
server {
ssl*certificate /etc/lego/certificates/*.domain.com.crt;
ssl*certificate_key /etc/lego/certificates/*.domain.com.key;
ssl*trusted_certificate /etc/lego/certificates/*.domain.com.issuer.crt;
}
```

## Creating a `systemd` timer

Instead of relying on cronjobs to refresh, we'll use the modern alternative that is now available. It
is up to you to set how frequently you want to attempt to refresh the certificates, but know that

1. It will not refresh it unless it will expire in less than 30 days
2. By default `certbot` tries to refresh twice daily, which we will do as well.

Create a new timer with `sudoedit /etc/systemd/system/lego.timer` and paste the following into it.

```
[Unit]
Description=Run lego twice daily

[Timer]
OnCalendar=_-_-\* 00,12:00:00 # <1>
RandomizedDelaySec=43200 # <2>
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

1. The format is `DayOfWeek Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second`, with `*` being a wildcard
2. But at some random interval so that it is not exactly 1200 and 2400 when it runs, but somewhere in a 12-hour range

Again, refresh the daemon: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, enable it: `sudo systemctl enable lego.timer` and then
start it: `sudo systemctl start lego.timer`. After this, running `systemctl list-timers` should have a line for the
`lego` service:

```
Sun 2020-12-20 07:15:02 CET  8h left    n/a                          n/a          lego.timer                   lego.service
```

## Conclusion

That's it, you now have a nginx server with automatic refreshing of certificates using lego.
