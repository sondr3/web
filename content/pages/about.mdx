Hello, I'm Sondre! I'm a master student on my first year studying algorithms at the
[University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/) with a passion for safe and reliable
software, open source and programming. I'm also a firm believer in applying the KISS principle
and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly
typed languages, Linux and mechanical keyboards.
