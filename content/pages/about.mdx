I'm a computer technology student at the [University of
Bergen](https://www.uib.no/) with a passion for safe and reliable software, open
source and programming. I'm also a firm believer in applying the KISS principle
and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly
typed languages, Linux and mechanical keyboards.
