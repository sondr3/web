Sondre Nilsen

Hello, I'm Sondre! I'm a master student on my first year studying algorithms at the 
https://www.uib.no/[University of Bergen] with a passion for safe and reliable software, open
source and programming. I'm also a firm believer in applying the KISS principle
and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly
typed languages, Linux and mechanical keyboards.
