      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a computer security student at the <a href="https://www.uib.no/">University of Bergen</a> with a
        passion for safe and reliable software, open source and programming. I&apos;m also a firm believer in applying
        the KISS principle and the worse is better philosophy to my projects. I enjoy and use strongly typed languages,
        Linux and mechanical keyboards.
